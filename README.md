# Stellar-Generator

Somewhat generic procedural generator of galaxies, stellar clusters,
sectors, (simple) star systems, planets, minor planets, moons and so on.

The attempted scale goes from galaxy-level (generating the density function
and cluster groups from a seed) to the surface and atmosphere characteristic
of stellar objects in hydrostatic equilibrium.
